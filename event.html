    <p>The Image Gallery paragraph is separate from the Media Library. Due to this, you currently cannot add items from the media library into an image gallery and instead must upload them separately. However, you can still view a listing of all your gallery images by navigating to [your site url]/admin/content/media and filtering by the Type of Gallery Images. </p>
